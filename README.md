# Pomodoro-Timer
This is my first real fullstack solo project.
I wanted to make this as I found it a simple good first fullstack project by myself
but also because I wanted to create a Pomodoro-Timer that fit my aesthetic

** A lot of timers are too bright **

I want to aim for a timer with a sleek desgin and a darker background.
Something similar to MonkeyType as that website keeps me focused and is a nice dark tone.
